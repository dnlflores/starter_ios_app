# Tool-Specific Chats Implementation Summary

## Overview
The chat feature has been updated to support tool-specific conversations. Now, when a user taps the "Start Chat" button on a tool detail page, it creates a new conversation specific to that tool if one doesn't already exist.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Database Schema Updates (`setup.js`)
- Added `tool_id` column to the `chats` table with foreign key reference to `tools(id)`
- Added migration to add the column to existing tables
- Created new indexes for efficient tool-specific queries:
  - `idx_chats_tool_conversation` on `(sender_id, recipient_id, tool_id, created_at)`
  - `idx_chats_tool` on `(tool_id)`

#### 2. API Endpoint Updates (`index.js`)
- Updated all chat queries to include tool information:
  - Added `LEFT JOIN tools t ON c.tool_id = t.id`
  - Added `tool_name` and `tool_description` fields to responses
- Updated chat creation endpoint to accept `tool_id` parameter
- Added new endpoint for tool-specific conversations: `GET /chats/conversation/:userId/:toolId`
- Updated conversation grouping to consider both user and tool ID

#### 3. WebSocket Service (`websocket-service.js`)
- No changes needed - the service already passes through all message data including the new tool fields

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Data Models (`Network.swift`)
- Updated `ChatAPIMessage` struct to include `tool_id` field
- Updated `DetailedChatAPIMessage` struct to include `tool_id`, `tool_name`, and `tool_description` fields
- Updated `createChatMessage` function to accept optional `toolId` parameter

#### 2. Chat Manager (`ChatManager.swift`)
- Updated `ChatMessage` struct to include `toolId` field
- Updated `Chat` struct to include:
  - `toolId` field
  - `toolName` field
  - Changed `id` from `Int` to `String` for unique tool-specific identifiers
  - Added `generateId` static method for creating unique chat IDs
- Updated chat grouping logic to create separate conversations for each tool
- Updated `startChat` method to accept tool information
- Updated `send` method to include tool ID
- Updated `chat` retrieval method to handle tool-specific lookups
- Updated real-time message handling for tool-specific conversations

#### 3. UI Components

##### ChatDetailView (`ChatDetailView.swift`)
- Updated to use String chat IDs instead of Int
- Updated send functionality to include tool information
- Updated navigation title to show tool name when available
- Format: "Username - Tool Name" for tool-specific chats

##### ChatView (`ChatView.swift`)
- Updated chat list to display tool information
- Shows "About: [Tool Name]" for tool-specific conversations

##### ToolDetailView (`ToolDetailView.swift`)
- Updated "Start Chat" button to create tool-specific conversations
- Passes tool ID and name to the chat creation

## How It Works

1. **Tool-Specific Chat Creation**: When a user taps "Start Chat" on a tool detail page, the system creates a conversation with a unique ID combining the user ID and tool ID (e.g., "123_456" for user 123 and tool 456).

2. **Conversation Separation**: Each tool gets its own conversation thread between the same users. For example, if User A and User B discuss Tool 1, they'll have a separate conversation from their discussion about Tool 2.

3. **Chat Identification**: The system uses compound IDs to uniquely identify conversations:
   - User-only chats: "123" (for backward compatibility)
   - Tool-specific chats: "123_456" (user ID + tool ID)

4. **UI Display**: The chat list shows the tool name for tool-specific conversations, and the chat detail view includes the tool name in the navigation title.

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Start the backend server** - The database schema will be automatically updated when the server starts
2. **Open the iOS app** and log in
3. **Navigate to a tool detail page** and tap "Start Chat"
4. **Verify** that a new conversation is created with the tool name displayed
5. **Send messages** to ensure they're properly associated with the tool
6. **Test with multiple tools** to ensure separate conversations are maintained

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing chats without tool associations continue to work
- The API accepts both old and new message formats
- Legacy endpoints are preserved while new tool-specific endpoints are added

## Database Migration

The database will be automatically updated when the backend server starts in production. The migration:
1. Adds the `tool_id` column to the `chats` table
2. Creates the necessary indexes
3. Preserves existing chat data
