# starter_ios_app

This is a small SwiftUI starter project used for demonstration purposes.

The app requests access to your location when the map is displayed. If permission is denied, the map defaults to showing San Francisco.

## Authentication Persistence

After logging in, the received authentication token is stored locally so you remain logged in when reopening the app. A new **Log Out** button in the account tab clears this token if you wish to sign out.

## Account Tab

The account tab now features a colorful gradient background with a large profile
icon and user details presented inside a rounded card for a cleaner look.

## Theme

The application now uses a black and orange color scheme applied across all tab
views for a consistent appearance.

## Posting Tools

The new listing screen now scrolls while the keyboard is visible, allowing address search results to remain visible without dismissing the keyboard.
