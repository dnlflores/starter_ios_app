# WebSocket Connection Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Addressed

The original WebSocket implementation was experiencing continuous disconnect/reconnect cycles causing performance issues and connection instability. The following problems were identified and fixed:

### 1. **Aggressive Reconnection Logic**
- **Problem**: Every connection error triggered an immediate reconnection attempt after exactly 3 seconds
- **Solution**: Implemented exponential backoff with jitter (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → up to 30s max)

### 2. **No Connection State Management**
- **Problem**: Multiple concurrent connection attempts could be initiated
- **Solution**: Added `isConnecting` flag to prevent overlapping connection attempts

### 3. **No Retry Limits**
- **Problem**: App would retry indefinitely, even when server was down
- **Solution**: Added maximum retry limit (10 attempts) with clear user feedback

### 4. **Poor Error Handling**
- **Problem**: All errors were treated the same way, including expected disconnections
- **Solution**: Added specific handling for different error types (cancelled, network lost, timeout, etc.)

### 5. **Aggressive Ping Intervals**
- **Problem**: 30-second ping intervals created unnecessary server load
- **Solution**: Increased to 60-second intervals to reduce load on hosted server

## Key Improvements

### **Exponential Backoff with Jitter**
```swift
// Prevents thundering herd problem and reduces server load
reconnectDelay = min(reconnectDelay * 2 + Double.random(in: 0...1), maxReconnectDelay)
```

### **Smart Error Handling**
- **Cancelled connections**: No reconnection attempt
- **Network issues**: Retry with backoff
- **Authentication failures**: Stop retrying
- **Max retries reached**: Clear user feedback

### **Connection State Management**
- Prevents multiple concurrent connections
- Tracks reconnection attempts and delays
- Provides detailed status updates

### **Enhanced User Experience**
- Connection status indicator in chat view
- Manual retry button when disconnected
- Clear feedback on connection state
- Graceful degradation when WebSocket is unavailable

## Files Modified

### `WebSocketManager.swift`
- Added connection state management properties
- Implemented exponential backoff logic
- Enhanced error handling for different error types
- Added manual reconnection methods
- Improved logging for debugging

### `ChatManager.swift`
- Added WebSocket connection health checks
- Automatic reconnection when sending messages
- Public methods for manual reconnection
- Connection status exposure for UI

### `ChatView.swift`
- Added connection status indicator
- Manual retry button for disconnected state
- Visual feedback for connection issues

## Configuration

### **Reconnection Settings**
- **Initial delay**: 1 second
- **Maximum delay**: 30 seconds
- **Maximum attempts**: 10
- **Ping interval**: 60 seconds
- **Backoff strategy**: Exponential with jitter

### **Error Handling Strategy**
1. **Cancelled**: No retry (user-initiated)
2. **Network lost**: Retry with backoff
3. **Timeout**: Retry with backoff
4. **Authentication failure**: Stop retrying
5. **Max retries**: Display failure message

## Usage

### **Automatic Reconnection**
The WebSocket automatically reconnects on connection failures with intelligent backoff.

### **Manual Reconnection**
Users can manually retry connections using:
```swift
chatManager.reconnectWebSocket()
```

### **Connection Status**
Monitor connection status via:
```swift
chatManager.webSocketStatus
chatManager.webSocketManager.isConnected
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Server Load**: Less aggressive reconnection and ping intervals
2. **Better Reliability**: Smart error handling and connection state management
3. **Improved UX**: Clear status feedback and manual retry options
4. **Battery Efficiency**: Exponential backoff reduces unnecessary network activity
5. **Debugging Support**: Enhanced logging for troubleshooting connection issues

## Render.com Specific Optimizations

Since the backend is hosted on Render.com's free tier:

1. **Sleep handling**: Server may go to sleep; reconnection logic handles wake-up
2. **Connection limits**: Reduced ping frequency to minimize resource usage
3. **Cold starts**: Exponential backoff allows time for server to fully initialize
4. **TLS issues**: Specific handling for SSL/TLS connection failures

The improved WebSocket implementation provides a much more stable and user-friendly chat experience while being respectful of server resources and network conditions.
